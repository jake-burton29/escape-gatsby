                    There is parking all around us. It is a bit confusing but
                    there is a parking garage and uncovered lots. Please pay
                    attention to the signage as Park City is consistently trying
                    to improve parking. Park City buses are still free and
                    drop-off at the main terminal is right across the street.
                    From there, we are at the Gateway Center, on the corner of

                    all the fun? For an additional fee, we can provide a Game
                    Master to play the room with kids-only groups to help
                    increase their experience. The fee is $35. Please indicate
                    on your reservation the number and age of children in your
                    group. If you would like a Game Master to play with your

                    The Mine Trap room plays best for teams of 6-10 adults and
                    kids; the Travel Room plays best for teams of 4-6, our
                    Parlor plays best for teams of 4 to 6 players and the Pirate
                    Booty is best for 4-8. However, smaller teams can also do
                    great and you do need at least two people to play any room.
