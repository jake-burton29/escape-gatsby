                    Escape Room Park City is an adventure game with interactive
                    puzzles where you and your team use wits, problem-solving,
                    and teamwork to find clues, solve challenges, and escape the
                    room. Most of all you will have fun!

                    There is parking all around us. It is a bit confusing but
                    there is a parking garage and uncovered lots. Please pay
                    attention to the signage as Park City is consistently trying
                    to improve parking. Park City buses are still free and
                    drop-off at the main terminal is right across the street.
                    From there, we are at the Gateway Center, on the corner of
                    Swede Alley and Heber Avenue, on the second floor, above
                    Handle restaurant. Take the elevator up and keep an eye out
                    for our sign.

                    Yes, it's true, but it wouldn't be fun if they weren't. Game
                    Masters help you through the room offering clues so that you
                    don't get too frustrated. Our ultimate goal is to make sure
                    that you have a good time.

                    Families have an amazing time! Children are welcome but may
                    be distracting to other players, so please indicate their
                    ages on your reservation. Children 18 years old or younger
                    must be accompanied by a parent or guardian in any of our
                    rooms. Our insurance requires it. You can also call us at
                    435-604-0556 if you have any questions We strongly encourage
                    parents to play the room with their kids - why let them have
                    all the fun? For an additional fee, we can provide a Game
                    Master to play the room with kids-only groups to help
                    increase their experience. The fee is $35. Please indicate
                    on your reservation the number and age of children in your
                    group. If you would like a Game Master to play with your
                    children, give us a call at 435-604-0556.

                    The Mine Trap room plays best for teams of 6-10 adults and
                    kids; the Travel Room plays best for teams of 4-6, our
                    Parlor plays best for teams of 4 to 6 players and the Pirate
                    Booty is best for 4-8. However, smaller teams can also do
                    great and you do need at least two people to play any room.
                    If you would like to book a team of more than 10, please
                    call us at 435-604-0556. Please note that in order to play
                    with less than 4 people you may have to pay for the minimum
                    amount of people.

                    Nope! While commonly called "escape rooms," we don't
                    actually lock anyone in. The door you enter is always
                    unlocked, and you can walk out at any time.

                    If you are able to visit a doctor's office, you will be fine
                    in our Escape Rooms. None of our rooms have confined spaces
                    and ceiling heights are normal. Once you are in the room the
                    focus is on the puzzles and games. You will become so
                    engaged with the fun you will not even notice that you are
                    in a room at all. And, you are never really "locked in‚Äù.
