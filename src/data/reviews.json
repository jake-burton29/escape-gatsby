      "content": "A great escape room! We (three adults) did the Parlor - murder mystery. The room was a lot of fun, with all sorts of puzzles. The puzzles ranged in scale and type, and they were arranged in parallel so that different groups of people could do different puzzles at the same time. We've done dozens of escape rooms, and this is one of our favorites. Highly recommend!",
